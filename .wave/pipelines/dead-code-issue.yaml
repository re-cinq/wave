        Scan for dead or redundant code: {{ input }}

        ## What to Look For

        1. **Unused exports**: Exported functions, types, constants, or variables
           that are never referenced outside their package.

        2. **Unreachable code**: Code after return/panic, impossible branches,
           dead switch cases.

        3. **Orphaned files**: Files not imported by any other file in the project.

        4. **Redundant / duplicate code**: Duplicate functions or copy-paste blocks
           across packages. Functions with identical signatures in different packages.

        5. **Stale tests**: Tests for functions that no longer exist,
           or tests that test nothing meaningful.

        6. **Unused imports**: Imports that are no longer needed.

        7. **Commented-out code**: Large blocks of commented code that
           should be deleted (git has history).

        8. **Stale glue code**: Adapter or wrapper functions that once connected
           components but now have no consumers.

        9. **Hardcoded values**: Magic numbers, hardcoded strings, or configuration
           values that should be extracted to constants, env vars, or config files.

        ## Verification

        For each finding, verify it's truly dead:
        - Grep for all references across the entire codebase
        - Check for reflect-based or string-based usage
        - Check if it's part of an interface implementation
        - Check for build tag conditional compilation

        Produce a structured JSON result matching the contract schema.
        Only include findings with high or medium confidence. Skip low confidence.

        Transform the raw scan results into a human-readable markdown summary report.

        ## Markdown Body Format

        ```markdown
        ## Summary

        Found **N** potential issues across **M** categories.
        **H** high-confidence findings are safe to remove.

        ## Findings by Category

        ### Unused Exports (X findings)

        | ID | Location | Symbol | Confidence | Action |
        |----|----------|--------|------------|--------|
        | DC-001 | path/file.go:10-25 | FuncName | high | remove |

        ### [Other categories...]

        ## Recommended Actions

        Create a GitHub issue with the dead code scan findings.

        1. Read the report artifact to get the title and body
        2. Create a GitHub issue:

           ```bash
           gh issue create --title "<title from report>" --body-file .wave/artifacts/report --label "code-quality"
           ```

        3. Produce a JSON status report matching the contract schema.

        type: json
