        MANDATORY: You MUST call the Bash tool. NEVER say "glab CLI not installed" without trying.

        Input: {{ input }}

        Parse the input:
        - Split on " -- " to separate the repo+number from optional criticism.
        - The first part is "<owner/repo> <number>". Extract REPO (first token) and NUMBER (second token).
        - If there is text after " -- ", that is the user's CRITICISM about what's wrong with the issue.
        - If there is no " -- ", criticism is empty.

        Execute these commands using the Bash tool:

        1. glab --version

        2. Fetch the full issue:
           glab issue view NUMBER --repo REPO --output json

        3. Get commits since the issue was created (cap at 100):
           git log --since="<createdAt>" --oneline -100

        4. Get releases since the issue was created:
           glab release list --repo REPO
           Then filter to only releases after the issue's createdAt date.

        5. Scan the issue body for file path references (anything matching patterns like
           `internal/...`, `cmd/...`, `.wave/...`, or backtick-quoted paths).
           For each referenced file, check if it still exists using `ls -la <path>`.

        6. Read CLAUDE.md for current project context:
           Read the file CLAUDE.md from the repository root.

        After gathering ALL data, produce a JSON result matching the contract schema.

        The context artifact contains the gathered issue context.

        Your task: Compare the original issue against the codebase changes and draft an updated version.

        Step 1: Analyze each section of the issue body. Classify each as:
        - STILL_VALID: Content is accurate and up-to-date
        - OUTDATED: Content references old behavior, removed files, or superseded patterns
        - INCOMPLETE: Content is partially correct but missing recent developments
        - WRONG: Content is factually incorrect given current codebase state

        Step 2: If there is user criticism (non-empty "criticism" field), address EVERY point raised.
        The criticism takes priority — it represents what the issue author thinks is wrong.

        Step 3: Draft the updated issue:
        - Preserve sections classified as STILL_VALID (do not rewrite what works)
        - Rewrite OUTDATED and WRONG sections to reflect current reality
        - Expand INCOMPLETE sections with missing information
        - If the title needs updating, draft a new title
        - Append a "---\n**Changes since original**" section at the bottom listing what changed and why

        Step 4: If file paths in the issue body are now missing (from referenced_files.missing),
        update or remove those references.

        Produce a JSON result matching the contract schema.

        CRITICAL: You MUST use the Bash tool for all commands. Do NOT generate fake output.

        Step 1: Use Bash tool to verify glab works:
        glab --version

        Step 2: Extract the repo as "<owner>/<name>" and the issue number from the available artifacts.

        Step 3: Apply the update:
        - If title_changed is true:
          glab issue update <NUMBER> --repo <REPO> --title "<updated_title>"
        - Write the updated_body to a temp file, then apply it:
          Write updated_body to /tmp/issue-body.md
          glab issue update <NUMBER> --repo <REPO> --description "$(cat /tmp/issue-body.md)"
        - Clean up /tmp/issue-body.md after applying.

        Step 4: Verify the update was applied:
        glab issue view <NUMBER> --repo <REPO> --output json

        Compare the returned title and body against what was intended. Flag any discrepancies.

        Step 5: Record the results as a JSON object matching the contract schema.
