  - id: gather-context
    persona: gitea-analyst

      type: worktree
      branch: "{{ pipeline_id }}"
    exec:
      type: prompt
      source: |
        Input: {{ input }}

        Parse the input:
        - Split on " -- " to separate the repo+number from optional criticism.
        - The first part is "<owner/repo> <number>". Extract REPO (first token) and NUMBER (second token).
        - If there is text after " -- ", that is the user's CRITICISM about what's wrong with the issue.

        Execute these steps:

        1. Fetch the full issue:
           tea issue view NUMBER --repo REPO

        2. Get recent commits since the issue was created (cap at 30):
           git log --since="<createdAt>" --oneline -30

        3. Scan the issue body for file path references (backtick-quoted paths, relative paths).
           For each referenced file, check if it still exists.

        Produce a JSON result matching the contract schema.

        The context artifact contains the gathered issue context.

        Compare the original issue against the codebase changes and draft an updated version.

        Step 1: Analyze each section of the issue body. Classify each as:
        - STILL_VALID: Content is accurate and up-to-date
        - OUTDATED: Content references old behavior, removed files, or superseded patterns
        - INCOMPLETE: Content is partially correct but missing recent developments
        - WRONG: Content is factually incorrect given current codebase state

        Step 2: If there is user criticism (non-empty "criticism" field), address EVERY point raised.
        The criticism takes priority — it represents what the issue author thinks is wrong.

        Step 3: Draft the updated issue:
        - Preserve sections classified as STILL_VALID (do not rewrite what works)
        - Rewrite OUTDATED and WRONG sections to reflect current reality
        - Expand INCOMPLETE sections with missing information
        - If the title needs updating, draft a new title
        - Append a "---\n**Changes since original**" section at the bottom listing what changed and why

        Step 4: If file paths in the issue body are now missing (from referenced_files.missing),
        update or remove those references.

        Produce a JSON result matching the contract schema.

        Extract the repo and issue number from the available artifacts.

        Apply the update:
        - If title_changed is true:
          tea issue edit <NUMBER> --repo <REPO> --title "<updated_title>"
        - Write the updated_body to a temp file, then apply it:
          tea issue edit <NUMBER> --repo <REPO> --body-file <temp_file>
        - Clean up the temp file after applying.

        Verify the update was applied:
        tea issue view <NUMBER> --repo <REPO>

        Compare the returned title and body against what was intended. Flag any discrepancies.

        Record the results as a JSON object matching the contract schema.
