input:

  example: "re-cinq/wave 42"
  schema:
    type: string
    description: "GitLab project with epic issue number (e.g. 'group/project 42')"

  - id: fetch-epic

      branch: "{{ pipeline_id }}"
    exec:
      type: prompt
      source: |
        Input: {{ input }}

        Parse the input: extract the project (first token) and the epic issue number (second token).

        Execute these steps:

        1. Fetch the epic issue with full details:
           glab issue view <NUMBER> --repo <PROJECT>

        2. List existing open issues to check for duplicates:
           glab issue list --repo <PROJECT>

        Analyze the epic:
        - Determine if this is truly an epic/umbrella issue (contains multiple work items)
        - Identify the key themes and work areas
        - Estimate overall complexity
        - Count how many sub-issues should be created (3-10)
        - List existing issues to avoid creating duplicates

        The assessment artifact contains the epic analysis. Use it to create well-scoped child issues.

        Input: {{ input }}
        Parse the project from the input (first token).

        For each planned sub-issue, create it using:
        glab issue create --repo <PROJECT> --title "<title>" --description "<body>" --label "<labels>"

        Each sub-issue body MUST include:
        - A "Parent: #<epic_number>" reference line
        - A clear Summary section
        - Acceptance Criteria as a checkbox list
        - Dependencies on other sub-issues if applicable
        - Scope Notes for what is explicitly excluded

        After creating all issues, capture each issue's number and URL from the creation output.

        Record the results with fields: parent_issue (number, url, repository),
        created_issues (array of number, title, url, labels, success, complexity, dependencies),
        total_created, total_failed.

        Verify the created sub-issues and post a summary comment on the epic.

        Input: {{ input }}
        Parse the project (first token) and epic number (second token).

        Step 1: For each created issue in the results, verify it exists:
        glab issue view <N> --repo <PROJECT>

        Check that each issue:
        - Exists and is open
        - Has acceptance criteria in the body
        - References the parent epic

        Step 2: Post a summary comment on the epic issue listing all created sub-issues:
        Create a markdown summary with a checklist of all sub-issues (- [ ] #<number> <title>)
        and post it using: glab issue note <EPIC_NUMBER> --repo <PROJECT> --message "<summary>"

        Step 3: Compile the verification report with fields:
        parent_issue (number, url), verified_issues (array of number, title, url, exists,
        has_acceptance_criteria, references_parent), summary (total_verified, total_valid,
        total_issues_created, comment_posted, comment_url).
