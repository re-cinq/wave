        Survey this project to build an onboarding guide: {{ input }}

        ## Survey Checklist

        1. **Project identity**: Find README, package manifests (go.mod, package.json),
           license, and config files. Determine language, framework, purpose.

        2. **Build system**: How to build, test, and run the project.
           Find Makefiles, scripts, CI configs, Dockerfiles.

        3. **Directory structure**: Map the top-level layout and key directories.
           What does each directory contain?

        4. **Architecture**: Identify the main components and how they interact.
           Find entry points (main.go, index.ts, etc.).

        5. **Dependencies**: List key dependencies and their purposes.
           Check go.mod, package.json, requirements.txt, etc.

        6. **Configuration**: Find environment variables, config files, feature flags.

        7. **Testing**: Where are tests? How to run them? What patterns are used?

        8. **Development workflow**: Find contributing guides, PR templates,
           commit conventions, branch strategies.

        9. **Documentation**: Where is documentation? Is it up to date?

        Write a comprehensive onboarding guide for new contributors.

        Using the injected project survey data, write a guide with these sections:

        # Onboarding Guide: [Project Name]

        ## Quick Start
        - Prerequisites (what to install)
        - Clone and build (exact commands)
        - Run tests (exact commands)
        - Run the project (exact commands)

        ## Project Overview
        - What this project does (2-3 sentences)
        - Key technologies and why they were chosen
        - High-level architecture (ASCII diagram)

        ## Directory Map
        - What each top-level directory contains
        - Where to find things (tests, configs, docs)

        ## Core Concepts
        - Key abstractions and terminology
        - How the main components interact
        - Data flow through the system

        ## Development Workflow
        - How to create a feature branch
        - Commit message conventions
        - How to run tests before pushing
        - PR process

        ## Common Tasks
        - "I want to add a new [feature/command/endpoint]" → where to start
        - "I want to fix a bug" → debugging approach
        - "I want to understand [component]" → where to look

        ## Helpful Resources
        - Documentation locations
        - Key files to read first
        - Related external docs

        Write for someone on their first day with this codebase.
        Be specific — use real paths, real commands, real examples.
