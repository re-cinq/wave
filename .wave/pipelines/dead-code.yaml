        Scan for dead or redundant code: {{ input }}

        ## What to Look For

        1. **Unused exports**: Exported functions, types, constants, or variables
           that are never referenced outside their package.

        2. **Unreachable code**: Code after return/panic, impossible branches,
           dead switch cases.

        3. **Orphaned files**: Files not imported by any other file in the project.

        4. **Redundant code**: Duplicate functions, copy-paste blocks,
           wrappers that add no value.

        5. **Stale tests**: Tests for functions that no longer exist,
           or tests that test nothing meaningful.

        6. **Unused dependencies**: Imports that are no longer needed.

        7. **Commented-out code**: Large blocks of commented code that
           should be deleted (git has history).

        ## Verification

        For each finding, verify it's truly dead:
        - Grep for all references across the entire codebase
        - Check for reflect-based or string-based usage
        - Check if it's part of an interface implementation
        - Check for build tag conditional compilation

        Write the result as JSON to output/dead-code-scan.json matching the contract schema.
        Include: target, findings (id, type, location, symbol, description, evidence, confidence,
        safe_to_remove, removal_note), summary (total_findings, by_type, high_confidence_count,
        estimated_lines_removable), and timestamp.
        Only include findings with high or medium confidence. Skip low confidence.

        Remove the dead code on this isolated worktree branch.

        Read the scan findings: cat artifacts/findings

        ## Process

        1. **Remove dead code** — ONLY high-confidence findings:
           - Start with unused imports (safest)
           - Then commented-out code blocks
           - Then unused exports
           - Then orphaned files
           - Skip anything with confidence=medium unless trivially safe
           - After each removal, verify: `go build ./...`

        2. **Run goimports** if available to clean up imports:
           ```bash
           goimports -w <modified-files> 2>/dev/null || true
           ```

        3. **Run full test suite**:
           ```bash
           go test ./... -count=1
           ```

        4. **Commit**:
           ```bash
           git add <specific-files>
           git commit -m "chore: remove dead code

           Removed N items of dead code:
           - DC-001: <symbol> (unused export)
           - DC-002: <file> (orphaned file)
           ..."
           ```

        Do NOT push — the next step will create a PR.

        If ANY test fails after a removal, revert that specific removal
        and continue with the next item.

        Verify the dead code removal was safe.

        Read the original findings: cat artifacts/original_findings

        Check:
        1. Were only high-confidence items removed?
        2. Are all tests still passing?
        3. Does the project still build cleanly?
        4. Were any false positives accidentally removed?
        5. Is the commit focused (no unrelated changes)?

        Output a verification report to output/verification.md:
        - Items removed (with justification)
        - Items skipped (with reason)
        - Lines of code removed
        - Test status
        - Overall assessment: CLEAN / NEEDS_REVIEW

        Create a pull request for the dead code removal.

        ## Working Directory

        You are running in an **isolated git worktree** shared with previous pipeline steps.
        Your working directory IS the project root. The branch already exists from the
        clean step — just push it and create the PR.

        ## SAFETY: Do NOT Modify the Working Tree

        This step MUST NOT run `git checkout`, `git stash`, or any command that changes
        the current branch or working tree state.

        ## Instructions

        ### Step 1: Load Context

        Read `artifacts/findings` to get the scan results (what was found).
        Read `artifacts/verification_report` to get the verification outcome.

        ### Step 2: Push the Branch

        ```bash
        git push -u origin HEAD
        ```

        ### Step 3: Create Pull Request

        ```bash
        gh pr create --title "chore: remove dead code" --body "$(cat <<'PREOF'
        ## Summary

        Automated dead code removal based on static analysis scan.

        <summarize what was removed: N items, types, estimated lines saved>

        ## Verification

        <summarize verification report: CLEAN or NEEDS_REVIEW, test status>

        ## Removed Items

        <list each removed item with its ID, type, and location>

        ## Test Plan

        - Full test suite passed after each removal
        - Build verified clean after all removals
        - Auditor persona verified no false positives
        PREOF
        )"
        ```

        ### Step 4: Request Copilot Review (Best-Effort)

        ```bash
        gh pr edit --add-reviewer "copilot" 2>/dev/null || true
        ```

        ## CONSTRAINTS

        - Do NOT spawn Task subagents — work directly in the main context
        - Do NOT run `git checkout`, `git stash`, or any branch-switching commands
        - Do NOT include Co-Authored-By or AI attribution in commits

        ## Output

        Write a JSON status report to `output/pr-result.json`:

        ```json
        {
          "pr_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123",
          "pr_number": 123,
          "branch": "chore/<pipeline_id>",
          "copilot_review_requested": true,
          "items_removed": 5,
          "lines_removed": 120,
