        Fetch the GitHub issue specified in the input: {{ input }}

        The input format is "owner/repo issue_number" (e.g., "re-cinq/CFOAgent 112").

        Parse the input to extract the repository and issue number.
        Use the gh CLI to fetch the issue:

        gh issue view <number> --repo <owner/repo> --json number,title,body,labels,state,author,createdAt,url,comments

        Parse the output and produce structured JSON with the issue content.
        Include repository information in the output.

        Write the result to output/issue-content.json

        Analyze the GitHub issue and extract research topics.

        Read the issue content from: artifacts/issue

        Identify:
        1. Key technical questions that need external research
        2. Domain concepts that require clarification
        3. External dependencies, libraries, or tools to investigate
        4. Similar problems/solutions that might provide guidance

        For each topic, provide:
        - A unique ID (TOPIC-001, TOPIC-002, etc.)
        - A clear title
        - Specific questions to answer (1-5 questions per topic)
        - Search keywords for web research
        - Priority (critical/high/medium/low based on relevance to solving the issue)
        - Category (technical/documentation/best_practices/security/performance/compatibility/other)

        Focus on topics that will provide actionable insights for the issue author.
        Limit to 10 most important topics.

        Research the topics identified in the research plan.

        Original issue: artifacts/issue
        Research plan: artifacts/research_plan

        For each topic in the research plan:
        1. Execute web searches using the provided keywords
        2. Evaluate source credibility (official docs > authoritative > community)
        3. Extract relevant findings with key points
        4. Include direct quotes where helpful
        5. Rate your confidence in the answer (high/medium/low/inconclusive)

        For each finding:
        - Assign a unique ID (FINDING-001, FINDING-002, etc.)
        - Provide a summary (20-2000 characters)
        - List key points as bullet items
        - Include source URL, title, and type
        - Rate relevance to the topic (0-1)

        Always include source URLs for attribution.
        If a topic yields no useful results, mark confidence as "inconclusive".
        Document any gaps in the research.

        Synthesize the research findings into a coherent report for the GitHub issue.

        Original issue: artifacts/original_issue
        Research findings: artifacts/research

        Create a well-structured research report that includes:

        1. Executive Summary:
           - Brief overview (50-1000 chars)
           - Key findings (1-7 bullet points)
           - Primary recommendation
           - Confidence assessment (high/medium/low)

        2. Detailed Findings:
           - Organize by topic/section
           - Include code examples where relevant
           - Reference sources using SRC-### IDs

        3. Recommendations:
           - Actionable items with IDs (REC-001, REC-002, etc.)
           - Priority and effort estimates
           - Maximum 10 recommendations

        4. Sources:
           - List all sources with IDs (SRC-001, SRC-002, etc.)
           - Include URL, title, type, and reliability

        5. Pre-rendered Markdown:
           - Generate complete markdown_content field ready for GitHub comment
           - Use proper headers, bullet points, and formatting
           - Include a header: "## Research Findings (Wave Pipeline)"
           - End with sources section

        Post the research report as a comment on the GitHub issue.

        Issue details: artifacts/issue
        Report: artifacts/report

        Steps:
        1. Read the issue details to get the repository and issue number
        2. Read the report to get the markdown_content
        3. Write the markdown content to a file, then use gh CLI to post the comment:

           # Write to file to avoid shell escaping issues with large markdown
           cat > /tmp/comment-body.md << 'COMMENT_EOF'
           <markdown_content>
           COMMENT_EOF

           gh issue comment <number> --repo <owner/repo> --body-file /tmp/comment-body.md

        4. Add a footer to the comment:
           ---
           *Generated by [Wave](https://github.com/re-cinq/wave) issue-research pipeline*

        5. Capture the result and verify success
        6. If successful, extract the comment URL from the output

        Write the result to output/comment-result.json with:
        - success: true/false
        - issue_reference: issue number and repository
        - comment: id, url, body_length (if successful)
        - error: code, message, retryable (if failed)
        - timestamp: current time
