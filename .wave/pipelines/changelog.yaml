        Analyze git history for changelog generation: {{ input }}

        ## Process

        1. **Determine range**: Parse input to identify the commit range.
           If tags mentioned, use them. If time period, calculate dates.
           If unclear, use last tag to HEAD (or last 50 commits).

        2. **Extract commits**: Use `git log --format` to get hash, author,
           date, subject, and body for each commit.

        3. **Parse conventional commits**: Categorize by prefix:
           feat → Features, fix → Fixes, docs → Documentation,
           refactor → Refactoring, test → Testing, chore → Maintenance,
           perf → Performance, ci → CI/CD, no prefix → Other

        4. **Identify breaking changes**: Look for `BREAKING CHANGE:` in body,
           `!` after prefix, API removals in body.

        5. **Extract scope**: Parse from prefix (e.g., `fix(pipeline):` → "pipeline")

        Write the result as JSON to output/commit-analysis.json matching the contract schema.
        Include: range (from, to, total_commits, date_range), commits (hash, author, date,
        type, scope, subject, breaking), summary (by_type, breaking_changes, contributors,
        most_changed_scopes), and timestamp.

        Categorize and describe changes for a changelog.

        Read the commit analysis: cat artifacts/raw_commits

        ## Rules

        1. **Group by type** into sections
        2. **Write user-facing descriptions**: Rewrite technical messages into
           clear descriptions focused on what changed and why it matters.
        3. **Highlight breaking changes** first with migration notes
        4. **Deduplicate**: Combine commits for the same logical change
        5. **Add context** for significant features

        Write the result as JSON to output/categorized-changes.json matching the contract schema.
        Include: version_label, breaking_changes (description, migration, related_commits),
        sections (title, type, entries), contributors, stats, and timestamp.

        Format categorized changes into a polished changelog.

        Read: cat artifacts/raw_commits && cat artifacts/changes

        Write to output/CHANGELOG.md in Keep a Changelog format:

        # Changelog

        ## [Version or Date Range] - YYYY-MM-DD

        ### Breaking Changes
        - **scope**: Description. Migration: what to do

        ### Added
        - **scope**: Feature description

        ### Fixed
        - **scope**: Bug fix description

        ### Changed
        - **scope**: Change description

        ### Security
        - **scope**: Security fix description

        Rules:
        - Only include sections with entries
        - Bold scope if present
        - Most notable entries first per section
        - One line per entry, concise
        - Contributors list at bottom
