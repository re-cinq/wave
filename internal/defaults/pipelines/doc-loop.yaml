  description: Pre-PR documentation consistency gate — scans changes, cross-references docs, and creates a GitHub issue with inconsistencies

  source: cli

  - id: scan-changes
    persona: navigator
    memory:
      strategy: fresh
    workspace:
      root: ./
      mount:

        Scan the repository to identify changed files and capture the current documentation state.

        ## Determine Scan Scope

        Input: {{ input }}

        - If the input is empty or blank: use `git log --name-status main...HEAD` to find files changed on the current branch vs main.
        - If the input is "full": skip the diff — treat ALL files as in-scope and scan all documentation.
        - Otherwise, treat the input as a git ref and use `git log --name-status <input>...HEAD`.

        Run `git log --oneline --name-status` with the appropriate range to get the list of changed files.
        If no commits are found (e.g. on main with no branch divergence), fall back to `git status --porcelain` for uncommitted changes.

        ## Categorize Changed Files

        Sort each changed file into one of these categories:
        - **go_code**: `*.go` files (excluding test files and cmd/wave/commands/)
        - **cli_commands**: files in `cmd/wave/commands/`
        - **pipelines**: files in `.wave/pipelines/` or `internal/defaults/pipelines/`
        - **personas**: files in `.wave/personas/` or `internal/defaults/personas/`
        - **contracts**: files in `.wave/contracts/` or `internal/defaults/contracts/`
        - **documentation**: `*.md` files, `docs/` directory
        - **other**: everything else

        ## Read Documentation Surface Area

        Read these key documentation files (if they exist) and write a brief summary of each:
        - README.md
        - CLAUDE.md
        - docs/reference/cli.md
        - docs/reference/environment.md
        - docs/guides/ (list all files)
        - cmd/wave/commands/*.go (scan for cobra command definitions, flags, and help text)

        ## Output

        Write the result as JSON to `output/scan-results.json` matching the doc-scan-results schema.
        Include:
        - scan_scope: mode ("diff" or "full"), range used, base_ref
        - changed_files: total_count + categories object with arrays of file paths
        - documentation_snapshot: array of {path, exists, summary} for each doc file
        - timestamp: current ISO 8601 timestamp

        Analyze documentation consistency by cross-referencing code changes with documentation.

        ## Cross-Reference Checks

        For each category of changed files, perform these checks:

        **CLI commands** (changed files in cmd/wave/commands/):
        - Compare cobra flag definitions and help text against docs/reference/cli.md and README.md
        - Check for new flags, removed flags, or changed descriptions
        - Verify command examples still work

        **Personas** (changed persona definitions):
        - Compare persona list against README.md persona documentation
        - Check persona descriptions match across wave.yaml, docs, and README
        - Verify persona permissions documented correctly

        **Pipelines** (changed pipeline definitions):
        - Compare pipeline list against README.md pipeline documentation
        - Check pipeline descriptions and step counts match docs
        - Verify referenced personas and contracts exist

        **Contracts** (changed contract schemas):
        - Check for orphaned contracts (referenced by no pipeline)
        - Check for missing contracts (referenced by pipeline but don't exist)

        **Environment variables**:
        - Scan Go code for os.Getenv/os.LookupEnv calls
        - Compare against docs/reference/environment.md
        - Flag undocumented environment variables

        **Go code changes**:
        - Check for new exported functions/types that might need API docs
        - Look for stale code comments referencing removed features

        ## Severity Rating

        Rate each inconsistency:
        - **CRITICAL**: Feature exists in code but completely missing from docs, or docs describe non-existent feature
        - **HIGH**: Incorrect information in docs (wrong flag name, wrong description, wrong behavior)
        - **MEDIUM**: Outdated information (stale counts, missing new options, incomplete lists)
        - **LOW**: Minor style issues, slightly imprecise wording

        ## Output

        Write the result as JSON to `output/consistency-report.json` matching the doc-consistency-report schema.
        Include:
        - summary: total_count, by_severity counts, clean (true if zero inconsistencies)
        - inconsistencies: array of {id (DOC-001 format), severity, category, title, description, source_location, doc_location, fix_description}
        - timestamp: current ISO 8601 timestamp

        If no inconsistencies are found, output an empty array with clean=true.

        Create a GitHub issue summarizing the documentation consistency report.

        Read the consistency report from: artifacts/report

        ## Check for Inconsistencies

        If the report has `summary.clean == true` (zero inconsistencies), skip issue creation:
        - Write `output/issue-result.json` with success=true, skipped=true, and the repository name
        - Do not create a GitHub issue

        ## Detect Repository

        Run: `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner`
        Use the result as the repository identifier.

        ## Create the Issue

        Build the issue body as markdown:

        ```
        ## Documentation Consistency Report

        **Scan date**: <timestamp from report>
        **Inconsistencies found**: <total_count>

        ### Summary by Severity
        | Severity | Count |
        |----------|-------|
        | Critical | N |
        | High     | N |
        | Medium   | N |
        | Low      | N |

        ### Task List

        For each inconsistency (sorted by severity, critical first):
        - [ ] **[DOC-001]** (CRITICAL) Title here — `doc_location`
          Fix: fix_description

        ---
        *Generated by [Wave](https://github.com/re-cinq/wave) doc-loop pipeline*
        ```

        Create the issue:
        ```
        # Write the markdown body to a file first to avoid shell escaping issues
        cat > /tmp/issue-body.md << 'ISSUE_EOF'
        <markdown body>
        ISSUE_EOF

        gh issue create \
          --title "docs: documentation consistency report — N inconsistencies found" \
          --body-file /tmp/issue-body.md \
          --label "documentation"
        ```

        If the `documentation` label doesn't exist, create without labels rather than failing.

        ## Output

        Write the result as JSON to `output/issue-result.json` matching the doc-issue-result schema.
        Include:
        - success: true/false
        - repository: owner/repo string
        - issue: {number, url, title, inconsistency_count} (if created)
        - skipped: true (if no inconsistencies)
        - error: {code, message, retryable} (if failed)
        - timestamp: current ISO 8601 timestamp
