        ## Exploration Steps

        1. **Find relevant files**: Use Glob and Grep to locate all files related
           to the topic. Cast a wide net — include implementations, tests, configs,
           and documentation.

        2. **Trace the call graph**: For key entry points, follow the execution flow.
           Note which functions call which, and how data flows through the system.

        3. **Identify key abstractions**: Find the core types, interfaces, and structs.
           Note their responsibilities and relationships.

        4. **Map dependencies**: Which packages/modules does this depend on?
           Which depend on it?

        5. **Find tests**: Locate test files that exercise this code.
           Tests often reveal intended behavior and edge cases.

        6. **Check configuration**: Find config files, constants, or environment
           variables that affect behavior.

        Analyze the architecture and design of the explored code.

        Review the injected exploration data, then read the key source files identified. Focus on:

        1. **Design patterns**: What patterns are used and why?
        2. **Data flow**: How does data enter, transform, and exit?
        3. **Error handling**: What's the error strategy?
        4. **Concurrency model**: Goroutines, channels, mutexes?
        5. **Extension points**: Where can new functionality be added?
        6. **Design decisions**: What trade-offs were made?

        Write a comprehensive explanation document.

        Review the injected exploration and architecture data, then produce a markdown document with:

        1. **Overview** — One paragraph summary
        2. **Key Concepts** — Core abstractions and terminology (glossary)
        3. **Architecture** — How pieces fit together (include ASCII diagram)
        4. **How It Works** — Step-by-step main execution flow with file:line refs
        5. **Design Decisions** — Decision → Rationale → Trade-off entries
        6. **Extension Guide** — How to add new functionality
        7. **Testing Strategy** — How the code is tested
        8. **Common Pitfalls** — Things that trip people up

        Write for an experienced developer new to this codebase.
        Use real file paths, function names, and type names.
